## Approach

This was a capstone project built during AlmaBetter training. Project goals included using backend technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I was supposed to build an API which return the proper data from the mongodb database. I started this process by using the `express` framework then adding `mongoose` for communicating with the database.

One of the main challenges i ran into was setting up the routes properly.
